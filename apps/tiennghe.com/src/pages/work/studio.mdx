One of the most important things for me when working from home is having the right tools.

I have spent a lot of time and effort to create a workspace that allows me to work efficiently and comfortably. My studio have fully equipped with all the necessary devices and accessories to help me complete my tasks.

So, let's start with my main device - the computer.
